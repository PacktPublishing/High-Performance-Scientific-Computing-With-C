# High Performance Scientific Computing with C [Video]
This is the code repository for [High Performance Scientific Computing with C [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/high-performance-scientific-computing-c-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789137842), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
In this course, you’ll learn to develop scientific and numerical programs that solve problems. It’s ideal for scientists, engineers, and programmers who need to model mathematical or physical systems. You’ll get a core toolkit of algorithms that can be used in a wide variety of applications, using the low-level capabilities of the C programming language. 
The close-to-the-metal approach means you’ll learn to optimize our programs to get the absolute best performance that our hardware can provide. You’ll see how the design of algorithms affects their performance and accuracy, the tools that can be used to optimize your code and develop your intuition about numerical problems. Finally, you’ll examine the growing array of parallel solutions that enable you to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, distributed compute clusters and GPU accelerators. 
By the end of this course, you’ll know how to write fast, accurate code that can run on many different platforms and solve many different scientific problems.

## Instructions and Navigation
### Assumed Knowledge
To fully benefit from the coverage included in this course, you will need:<br/>
This course is for scientists, engineers, or programmers who already know at least one programming language or have some basic knowledge of C. It’s ideal for those want to learn to use numerical solutions for complex mathematical problems. It’s for those who need to develop code to simulate physical systems, deal with continuous data, or squeeze extra performance out of their existing hardware.

### Technical Requirements
This course has the following software requirements:<br/>
This course will be taught using Linux, so a good understanding of UNIX is required.  You should be able to install packages (either from source or using the package manager of your choice), edit text files, and navigate around the command line comfortably.  To follow the OpenMP and CUDA examples, a CPU with 2+ cores, and a NVIDA GPU with Compute Capability of 3.0+ (NVIDA 700 series or newer)
